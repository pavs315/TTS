# Tacotron 2 and WaveGlow model TTS

The Tacotron 2 and WaveGlow model forms a text-to-speech system which synthesises human-like speech without additional prosody information. 

## Tacotron 2 - 
Tacotron 2 is a neural network architecture for natural speech synthesis. It consists of recurrenct seq2seq feature prediction netwoek which maps char embeddings to mel spectograms, which are usually fed into a vocoder to generate speech.
